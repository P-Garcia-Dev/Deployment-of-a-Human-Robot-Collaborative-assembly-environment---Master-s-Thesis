## Deployment of a Human-Robot-Collaborative assembly environment --> Master's Thesis in Mechanical Engineering, October 2021

Hi, I am Pedro and welcome to the github repository where all the files used for the development of my Master's Thesis will be shared.
The goal of this work was to create a Human-Robot Collaborative (HRC) assembly environment, where a robotic arm had the ability to "see" its surroundings in order to safely teamwork with a human in the assembly process of a mechanical component.

* 4 different pre-trained deep learning models were retrained and compared with a custom dataset: 2 Faster R-CNNs - ResNet-50 and ResNet-101; YOLOv2 - Darknet-19 and YOLOv3 - Darknet-53
* The best performing algorithm was then implemented with a robotic arm to create a successful industrial demonstrator

## Demonstration Video
